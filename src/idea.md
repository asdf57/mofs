The issue I'm currently having is deciding how to render the children of a directory.

For example:

Say we have '/'. Now, we give '/' a child FILE called 'abc'. So we now have '/abc'. Now let's also give a directory to 'l' called dir. So we have '/dir'.

The issue is that currently, since /abc and /dir don't have FSE entries, they have no entry in the hash table and thus don't get rendered.

Idea;
(1) Entries can dynamically entries OR entries can be harcoded using a C file and header file.
    e.g. we either dynamically generate or manually create an FSE entry for entries. '/abc' can be dynamically generated in the ROOT handler OR hardcoded and a abc.c/abc.h pair is created

(2) Each entry renders itself. So while the creation of entries can be harcoded or dynamically generated by the parent entry, each FSE is then used to render itself.

    So going back to earlier, say we have our '/abc' case. We have two options: (1) The root ('/') handler can dynamically generate an FSE for abc or (2) we can hardcode '/abc' by creating a C file and header. This same set of rules goes for '/dir'. Regardless, we'd then have an FSE entry for both entities, meaning that the standard follow-parent method to find the closest handler becomes applicable.








Rule of design

A C-header combo will only be created for *directories* and will contain all of the logic for that directory and its children (1-level deep).

Futher levels will receive their own C-header file combo.
